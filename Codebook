This is the codebook for the project of Week 4 for Getting and Cleaning Data

The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. 

About R script
File with R code "run_analysis2.R" performs several steps, according to assignments.

About variables:
x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
alltrain, alltest, finaldataset merge the previous datasets to further analysis.

columnsToKeep extracts only the measurments on the mean and standard deviation, human Activity then filters selected.

ActivityNames use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set. Those ActivityNames are rearanged in the next step, to put the descriptive activity as a first row.
